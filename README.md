# RepoRuler
Chrome extension that displays GitHub repository size in the About section next to forks and stars.

## Get Extension
`insert chrome extenstion link after i register it`

## GitHub
Works for public repos. Need to add a way to input a read-only PAT so users can view their private repos sizes as well

## GitLab
Work in progress... GitLab requires a PAT to get any repos information (public or private)

## How to Test
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Toggle "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" button and select the repo
